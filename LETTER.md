Hi Carrol,

I appreciate you bringing this exciting opportunity to our attention. Launching our new “Event Analyzer” feature in time for the upcoming conference would highlight our product’s innovative capabilities and attract significant market interest. However, our engineering team has raised concerns about some critical technical debt—especially in the data ingestion layer—that, if not addressed, could jeopardize system stability with the increased usage expected from this event.

Here are the trade-offs I see:

Fastest Path to Delivery: We could release the “Event Analyzer” feature quickly without fully resolving the technical debt. This would meet our immediate timeline but could result in performance issues (or even downtime) if usage exceeds our current capacity.

Technical Debt Remediation First: We could take the time to refactor and stabilize the data ingestion layer before launching the new feature. This would ensure a strong, scalable solution in the long run, but it might mean missing the conference deadline and the momentum it could create.

I suggest a balanced approach: we tackle the most critical data ingestion bottlenecks while developing a minimal viable version of the “Event Analyzer.” This way, we can strengthen our foundation to handle the event’s traffic demands while still delivering an appealing feature set on time. If we gain traction, we can continue to refine both the feature and any remaining debt after the conference.

Please let me know if this approach aligns with you or if we need to adjust. I’m confident that we can have a product with the slight re-prioritization. We can meet the conference deadline without compromising the stability of our platform.

Thanks for your support and understanding.

Best regards,

Adam
